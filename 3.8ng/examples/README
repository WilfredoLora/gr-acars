Basic example: 

go.m: GNU/Octave (Matlab compatible) demonstration of ACARS decoding on the sample
file

example.grc: multichannel decoding demonstration, assuming European bands
(primary on 131.725 MHz, secondary on 131.525 MHz and backup on 131.825 MHz, hence 
the +200 and -100 kHz FIR translating filters)

AM reception might be improved by adding PLL tracking and AGC, which might
require tuning the threshold for detecting ACARS messages ... to be tested.
